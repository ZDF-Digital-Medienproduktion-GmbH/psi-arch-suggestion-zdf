#PSI quick intro

## Who we are & what we want

PSI – Public Spaces Incubator is an international project of four broadcasters – CBC/Radio Canada, RTBF, SRG SSR, ZDF plus the non-profit New_Public who specializes in digital public spaces. The common goal is to think of, build and test interaction possibilities that will actively foster healthy conversation in digital spaces owned by the broadcasters. These should serve real user and societal needs and ideally help to (re)build trust in Public Service Media (PSM).

## What we are building

Across PSM tech and UX teams involved, we currently (11-2023) have built 83 ideas into low-fidelity Figma or coded prototypes. These prototypes are linked here: https://airtable.com/appirknT5spVWOPfi/shrwdOCqYOhwJ0k65/tblX7CMorsWg5t1wp Prototypes are based on user motivations around participation in constructive conversations. They are tested regularly in small groups among internal PSM stakeholders and members of the public via videocall sessions. The prototypes are small building blocks for interaction possibilities that may be combined to create a strong portfolio as a base for the MVP development phase. The interaction possibilities will eventually be applied to the content PSMs already have or are developing for this purpose.

## Open-ended development & software development

The MVP+ will encompass these interaction features. What that will look like exactly is yet to be defined (as of 11-2023). It will depend on testing and applicability of prototypes. So far undefined is also where these interaction possibilities will “live” in the future. Options include them being a part of PSM’s existing platforms and infrastructure, being add-ons to these platforms or a standalone solution that will closely communicate with content platforms of PSMs. Hence, conversations about software architecture are ongoing between partners. The MVP+ will not be tailored to PSMs systems. The adaptation to PSM’s individual system will happen _after_ the current end of the project. Either way, the MVP+ software will be open source under Apache License. Due to the international nature of the project, a federated approach is highly likely.
