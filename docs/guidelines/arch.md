# Guidelines on architecture

## Microservices
Each service should be implemented as a microservice that should be developed and deployed in no more than two sprints.

## Data exchange protocols
Data exchange protocols for backend services should be implemented as streaming capable protocols, such as protobuf, gRPC, message queues, pubsub.
