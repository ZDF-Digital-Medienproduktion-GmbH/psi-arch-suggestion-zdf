# Terms used in the project


## Sprint
Scrum sprints at ZDFD are a two week long development cycle.

## Prototype
Prototypes in PSI are used to evaluate technical and UX-assumptions the team made. They are small appliances that only serve the evaluation purpose. Code of prototypes is usually not implemented in the end product.

## Microservice
A microservice serves only one purpose (e.g. converting images or videos), can be developed in a short manner of time (2 sprints max.), does not require any global state or external dependencies.

## Component
A component of the system is a functional block that serves one specific requirement of the appliance. It can consist of multiple services, such as frontend and api services and other backend services.

## Application
Similarly to a prototype, the application serves one use case of the customer. It is built out of different components.

## Appliance
This describes one instance of the PSI-system that is configured for a broadcaster.
